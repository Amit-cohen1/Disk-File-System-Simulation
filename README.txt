==Description==

In this project, the user will enter a number between 1-8 to preform action simualting the disk management.

We will use the different methods declared in the exercise demands to excute the different commands.
We will allow to use the disk as close as we can simulate to the real Management disk. I choose to use in the vector and pointer to array 
structures to mantain the diffrent structs. I keep update the structs in all of the methods.
